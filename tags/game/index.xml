      <description>Demo Out! This past December, we released the demo of our upcoming title Galactic Rescue!
The demo is a 1-hr Sci-Fi Metroidvania packed with secrets, exploration, challenging battles and environmental puzzles.
You can read more about the game on itch.io.

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of the video game project I embarked some time ago and that has taken much longer than originally intended :P .I&amp;rsquo;ll probably make this into its own tab later since there are lots to talk about in here!
What is it? The game is a 2D metroidvania.If you are unfamiliar with that word, a quick internet search will give you an idea, but the gist of it is that the game is non-linear in its world design.</description>
