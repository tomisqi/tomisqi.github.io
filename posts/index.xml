      <description>Demo Out! This past December, we released the demo of our upcoming title Galactic Rescue!
The demo is a 1-hr Sci-Fi Metroidvania packed with secrets, exploration, challenging battles and environmental puzzles.
You can read more about the game on itch.io.

      <title>PDCCH Visualizer in IMGUI</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a tool that will let me visualize the PDCCH resources in NR, and I will show and discuss some of its features in this post. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that one way to understand something is to program a computer to do it. In the job of doing that, I typically find out gaps in my knowledge or even more so, areas for which I had only a superficial understanding for - &amp;ldquo;“The best way to understand something is to teach it to a computer” [1].</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of the video game project I embarked some time ago and that has taken much longer than originally intended :P .I&amp;rsquo;ll probably make this into its own tab later since there are lots to talk about in here!
What is it? The game is a 2D metroidvania.If you are unfamiliar with that word, a quick internet search will give you an idea, but the gist of it is that the game is non-linear in its world design.</description>

      <title>Frequency resource allocation in 5G NR</title>

      <description>This post will be about some reflections I had when reading about the frequency resource allocation in 5G NR. I will specifically discuss frequency resource allocation on DL since this is the area I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about.
In addition to giving a short description of resource allocation in 5G NR, I set out to answer the following questions:
 Why are the nominal resource block group (RBG) sizes the values they are?</description>
