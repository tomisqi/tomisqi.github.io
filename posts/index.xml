      <description>Now on GitHub pages! It took some work, but I now moved this site to GitHub pages. I am using an automated github action that builds and deploys the site.
Two repositories I am using a source repository to store the &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; of the website and a built site repository to store the built site. When I do changes, I only push to the &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; repository and a github action takes care of building the site using Hugo and pushing the built content into the &amp;ldquo;built site&amp;rdquo; repository.</description>

      <description>I am removing the &amp;lsquo;Projects&amp;rsquo; tab since I don&amp;rsquo;t find it very useful at the moment. What I had in there were some projects that I have published on GitHub.
Instead of having a separate tab, you can browse my repositories in here.</description>

      <title>PDCCH Visualizer in IMGUI</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a tool that will let me visualize the PDCCH resources in NR, and I will show and discuss some of its features in this post. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought that one way to understand something is to program a computer to do it. In the job of doing that, I typically find out gaps in my knowledge or even more so, areas for which I had only a superficial understanding for - &amp;ldquo;“The best way to understand something is to teach it to a computer” [1].</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll give an overview of the video game project I embarked some time ago and that has taken much longer than originally intended :P .
I&amp;rsquo;ll probably make this into its own tab later since there are lots to talk about in here!
What is it? The game is a 2D metroidvania.
If you are unfamiliar with that word, a quick internet search will give you an idea, but the gist of it is that the game is non-linear in its world design.</description>

      <title>Frequency resource allocation in 5G NR</title>

      <description>This post will be about some reflections I had when reading about the frequency resource allocation in 5G NR. I will specifically discuss frequency resource allocation on DL since this is the area I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about.
In addition to giving a short description of resource allocation in 5G NR, I set out to answer the following questions:
 Why are the nominal resource block group (RBG) sizes the values they are?</description>
